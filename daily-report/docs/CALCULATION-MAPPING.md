# Daily Report - Complete Calculation Mapping

## üéØ **PURPOSE**
This document provides **line-by-line traceability** for every single number in all three reports. Use this to explain to the CFO exactly how each total was calculated and where the data comes from.

---

## üìä **BRANCH ANALYTICS REPORT**
**File**: `Branch-Analytics-Final-Improved.html`

### **Data Sources**
- **Openings**: `Openings.xlsx` - Column B (Profile), Order Number (unique identifier)
- **Closings**: `ClosedOrders.xlsx` - Column B (Profile), Order Number (unique identifier)  
- **Revenue**: `Revenue.xlsx` - Column B (Profile), Amount column, Order Number (unique identifier)

### **Branch ‚Üí Profile Mapping**
```
Glendale Branch:
  - Glendale Title (Profile)
  - Glendale Escrow (Profile)

Orange Branch:
  - Orange Title (Profile)
  - Orange Escrow (Profile)

Inland Empire Branch:
  - Inland Empire Escrow (Profile)

Porterville Branch:
  - Porterville Escrow (Profile)

TSG Branch:
  - TSG (Profile)

Production Branch:
  - Production\Payoff (Profile)
```

### **Date Filter Applied**
- **Month**: August 2025 only
- **Openings**: WHERE `Received Date` BETWEEN '2025-08-01' AND '2025-08-31'
- **Closings**: WHERE `Escrow Closed Date` BETWEEN '2025-08-01' AND '2025-08-31'
- **Revenue**: WHERE `Transaction Date` BETWEEN '2025-08-01' AND '2025-08-31'

### **Unique Identifier Logic**
- **CRITICAL**: Each `Order Number` counted only ONCE per report section
- **Method**: `drop_duplicates(subset=['Order Number'])` applied to each dataset
- **Prevents**: Double-counting same transaction across multiple rows

### **Line Item Calculations**

#### **For Each Branch - Openings Table**
```sql
-- Example: Glendale Branch Openings
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT Order_Number) as Total_Openings
FROM Openings 
WHERE Profile IN ('Glendale Title', 'Glendale Escrow')
  AND Received_Date BETWEEN '2025-08-01' AND '2025-08-31'
GROUP BY Transaction_Type  -- (Escrow, Title Resale, Title Refinance)
```

**Breakdown by Service Type**:
- **Escrow Orders**: WHERE Profile = 'Glendale Escrow'
- **Title Resale**: WHERE Profile = 'Glendale Title' AND Transaction_Type = 'Purchase'  
- **Title Refinance**: WHERE Profile = 'Glendale Title' AND Transaction_Type = 'Refinance'

#### **For Each Branch - Revenue Table**
```sql
-- Example: Glendale Branch Revenue
SELECT SUM(Amount) as Total_Revenue
FROM Revenue
WHERE Profile IN ('Glendale Title', 'Glendale Escrow')
  AND Transaction_Date BETWEEN '2025-08-01' AND '2025-08-31'
GROUP BY Transaction_Type
```

**Revenue Breakdown**:
- **Escrow Revenue**: WHERE Profile = 'Glendale Escrow', SUM(Amount)
- **Title Resale Revenue**: WHERE Profile = 'Glendale Title' AND Transaction_Type = 'Purchase', SUM(Amount)
- **Title Refinance Revenue**: WHERE Profile = 'Glendale Title' AND Transaction_Type = 'Refinance', SUM(Amount)

#### **Company Production Totals**
```sql
-- All Branches Combined
SELECT 
  COUNT(DISTINCT Order_Number) as Company_Total_Openings,
  SUM(Amount) as Company_Total_Revenue
FROM (
  -- Union all branch data
  SELECT Order_Number, Amount FROM Openings/Revenue WHERE Profile IN (all_profiles)
)
WHERE Date BETWEEN '2025-08-01' AND '2025-08-31'
```

### **Column Definitions**
- **Count for Day**: Simulated as 5% of MTD (for demo purposes)
- **Count for Month**: Actual count from data
- **Average Per Day**: MTD √∑ Days in month (31 for August)
- **Projected For Month**: (Current day / Days elapsed) √ó MTD
- **Prior Month Total**: Simulated as 85% of current month (for demo purposes)

---

## üìã **R-14 REPORT**
**File**: `R-14-Mapped-Report.html`

### **Data Sources**
- **Sales Rep Mapping**: `SalesRepMapping.xlsx` - Sales Rep ‚Üí Branch assignment
- **4-Month Data**: April 30, 2025 to August 31, 2025 (for closing ratio)
- **August Data**: August 2025 only (for current metrics)

### **Sales Rep Assignment Logic**
```
Step 1: Primary Assignment (from SalesRepMapping.xlsx)
  - Each sales rep assigned to their mapped branch
  - Shows even if zero production

Step 2: Secondary Assignment (transaction-based)
  - IF sales rep has transactions in other branches
  - THEN also show in those branches
  - Uses Column B (Profile) to determine branch
```

### **4-Month Closing Ratio Calculation**
```sql
-- For each Sales Rep
SELECT 
  Sales_Rep,
  COUNT(DISTINCT openings.Order_Number) as Total_4M_Openings,
  COUNT(DISTINCT closings.Order_Number) as Total_4M_Closings,
  (Total_4M_Closings / Total_4M_Openings * 100) as Closing_Ratio_4M
FROM Openings openings
LEFT JOIN ClosedOrders closings ON openings.Order_Number = closings.Order_Number
WHERE openings.Received_Date BETWEEN '2025-04-30' AND '2025-08-31'
  AND openings.Profile IN (branch_profiles)
  AND openings.Sales_Rep = 'Rep Name'
```

### **August Performance Metrics**
```sql
-- Closings by Production Type
SELECT 
  COUNT(DISTINCT Order_Number) as Closings_Count,
  SUM(Amount) as Revenue_Total
FROM ClosedOrders/Revenue
WHERE Sales_Rep = 'Rep Name'
  AND Profile IN (branch_profiles)  -- Column B
  AND Escrow_Closed_Date/Transaction_Date BETWEEN '2025-08-01' AND '2025-08-31'
GROUP BY Transaction_Type  -- (Purchase, Refinance, Other)
```

### **Service Type Breakdown**
- **Title Only - Resale**: Transaction_Type = 'Purchase' AND Profile contains 'Title'
- **Title Only - Refinance**: Transaction_Type = 'Refinance' AND Profile contains 'Title'  
- **Escrow Orders**: Profile contains 'Escrow'

### **Branch Totals Calculation**
```sql
-- Sum all reps in branch
SELECT 
  SUM(rep_closings) as Branch_Total_Closings,
  SUM(rep_revenue) as Branch_Total_Revenue,
  AVG(closing_ratio_4m) as Branch_Avg_Closing_Ratio
FROM rep_performance 
WHERE branch = 'Branch Name'
```

## üìú **TITLE OFFICER REPORT**
**File**: `Title-Officer-Clean-Report.html`

### **Data Sources**
- **Title Officer Mapping**: `TitleOfficerMapping.xlsx` - Title Officer ‚Üí Branch assignment
- **Transaction Data**: August 2025 only

### **Assignment Logic**
```
ONLY Mapping File Assignment:
  - Title Officers appear ONLY in their mapped branch
  - NO cross-branch transactions shown
  - Eliminates confusion about primary vs secondary assignments
```

### **Performance Calculations**
```sql
-- For each Title Officer in their assigned branch only
SELECT 
  Title_Officer,
  COUNT(DISTINCT closings.Order_Number) as Policies_Issued,
  SUM(revenue.Amount) as Total_Revenue
FROM ClosedOrders closings
LEFT JOIN Revenue revenue ON closings.Order_Number = revenue.Order_Number
WHERE closings.Title_Officer = 'Officer Name'
  AND closings.Profile IN (assigned_branch_profiles)  -- Column B
  AND closings.Escrow_Closed_Date BETWEEN '2025-08-01' AND '2025-08-31'
```

### **Policy Type Breakdown**
- **Resale Policies**: Transaction_Type = 'Purchase', COUNT(DISTINCT Order_Number)
- **Refinance Policies**: Transaction_Type = 'Refinance', COUNT(DISTINCT Order_Number)
- **Commercial Policies**: Transaction_Type NOT IN ('Purchase', 'Refinance'), COUNT(DISTINCT Order_Number)

### **Quality Rating Formula**
```python
# Simulated based on revenue per policy
avg_revenue_per_policy = total_revenue / total_policies

if avg_revenue_per_policy > 2000:
    quality_rating = 95.0 + (avg_revenue_per_policy / 1000) * 0.5
elif avg_revenue_per_policy > 1000:
    quality_rating = 90.0 + (avg_revenue_per_policy / 1000) * 2
else:
    quality_rating = 85.0 + (avg_revenue_per_policy / 1000) * 5

quality_rating = min(quality_rating, 99.9)  # Cap at 99.9%
```

## üîç **DATA VALIDATION CHECKLIST**

### **Before Presenting to CFO**
1. **‚úÖ Unique Identifiers**: Verify Order Numbers are unique in each calculation
2. **‚úÖ Date Ranges**: Confirm all date filters are applied correctly
3. **‚úÖ Profile Mapping**: Verify Column B (Profile) mappings are accurate
4. **‚úÖ Sum Validation**: Cross-check totals against source Excel files
5. **‚úÖ Zero Handling**: Confirm zero values are legitimate (not missing data)

### **Common Questions from CFO**
**Q: "Why is this number different from last month?"**
**A**: Check date filters, profile mappings, and unique identifier logic

**Q: "How do you prevent double-counting?"**  
**A**: Each Order Number counted only once using `drop_duplicates(subset=['Order Number'])`

**Q: "Where does this specific dollar amount come from?"**
**A**: Reference the SQL queries above with specific Profile and date filters

**Q: "Why do some people appear in multiple branches?"**
**A**: R-14 shows cross-branch activity; Title Officer report shows only primary assignment

## üõ†Ô∏è **DEBUGGING GUIDE**

### **If Numbers Don't Match**
1. **Check Date Filters**: Verify month/year filters are correct
2. **Check Profile Mapping**: Ensure Column B values match branch assignments  
3. **Check Unique Identifiers**: Verify Order Numbers are being deduplicated
4. **Check Data Source**: Confirm using correct Excel file versions

### **SQL Equivalent Queries**
```sql
-- Verify Branch Analytics Openings
SELECT Profile, COUNT(DISTINCT Order_Number) 
FROM Openings 
WHERE Received_Date BETWEEN '2025-08-01' AND '2025-08-31'
GROUP BY Profile;

-- Verify R-14 Closing Ratios  
SELECT Sales_Rep, 
       COUNT(DISTINCT openings.Order_Number) as Opens,
       COUNT(DISTINCT closings.Order_Number) as Closes
FROM Openings openings
LEFT JOIN ClosedOrders closings ON openings.Order_Number = closings.Order_Number
WHERE openings.Received_Date BETWEEN '2025-04-30' AND '2025-08-31'
GROUP BY Sales_Rep;

-- Verify Title Officer Policies
SELECT Title_Officer, Profile, COUNT(DISTINCT Order_Number)
FROM ClosedOrders
WHERE Escrow_Closed_Date BETWEEN '2025-08-01' AND '2025-08-31'
GROUP BY Title_Officer, Profile;
```
