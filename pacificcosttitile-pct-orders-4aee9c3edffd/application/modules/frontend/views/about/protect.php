                    <p>After your sales contract has been accepted, Pacific Coast Title Company will search all related public records to look for any problems with the homeâ€™s title. This search typically involves a review of land records going back many years. More than 1/3 of all title searches reveal a problem with the title that we will make sure is fixed before you go to closing. For instance, a previous owner may have had minor construction done on the property, but never fully paid the contractor. Or the previous owner may have failed to pay local or state taxes. Pacific Coast Title Company seeks to resolve problems like these before you go to closing. Once we issue a title policy, if for some reason any claim which is covered under your title policy is ever filed against your property, Contact Pacific Coast Title Company and we will work diligently to process and help resolve your claim.</p><br>
