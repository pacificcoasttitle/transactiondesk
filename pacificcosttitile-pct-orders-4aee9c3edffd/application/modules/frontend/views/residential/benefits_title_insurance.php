					<div class="ui-decor-1 bg-primary"></div>
					<p>The purchaser of real estate needs protection against serious financial loss due to a defect
						in the title to the property purchased.</p>
					<p>For a single, one-time premium, which is a modest amount in relationship to the value of the
						property, a buyer can receive the protection of a title insurance policy - a policy that is
						backed by the reserves and solvency of the Company. A title insurance policy will cover both
						claims arising out of title problems that could have been discovered in the public records, and
						those so-called “non-record’ defects that could not be discovered in the
						record, even with the most complete search.</p>

					<p>A title insurance policy will not only protect the insured owner, but also that person’s heirs
						for as long as they hold title to the property. The Company will not only satisfy any valid
						claim made against the insured’s title, but it will pay for the costs and legal expenses of
						defending against a title claim.</p>

									<h2 class="ui-title-block ui-title-block_light">Benefits for the Lender</h2>
									<div class="ui-decor-1 bg-primary"></div>
									<p>The overwhelming majority of mortgage loans made in the United States are made by
										persons who are acting in a fiduciary capacity - by savings and loan
										associations, savings banks and commercial banks of behalf of their depositors,
										and by life insurance companies on behalf of their policy holders.</p>

									<p>Because they are lending other people’s money (other people’s savings or
										policy-holder’s funds) these lenders must be concerned with the safety of their
										mortgage investments. A policy of title insurance provides a mortgage lender
										with a high degree of safety against the loss of security as a result of a title
										problem. This protection remains in effect for as long as the mortgage remains
										unsatisfied.</p>

									<p>Pacific Coast Title also provides lenders with in-depth expertise on a wide
										variety of title related matters to facilitate the mortgage loan process.</p>

								<h2 class="ui-title-block ui-title-block_light">Benefits for the Seller</h2>
								<div class="ui-decor-1 bg-primary"></div>
								<p>An owner of real property whose interest is insured by an owner’s title insurance
									policy has the assurance that the title will be marketable when selling the
									property. The title insurance policy protects the seller from financial damage if
									the seller’s title is rejected by a prospective purchaser.</p>
								<br>

								<div class="typography-section__inner">
									<h2 class="ui-title-block ui-title-block_light">Benefits for the Real Estate Broker
									</h2>
									<div class="ui-decor-1 bg-primary"></div>
									<p>The title insurance company and the real estate agent both seek to ensure that as
										many
										purchases as possible are closed to the satisfaction of all principals in the
										transaction. From
										the broker’s standpoint, the efficient and safe transfer of title will result in
										client satisfaction,
										increased prestige, and continued business.</p>
