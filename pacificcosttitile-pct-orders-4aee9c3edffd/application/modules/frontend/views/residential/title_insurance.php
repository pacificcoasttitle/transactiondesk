					<div class="ui-decor-1 bg-primary"></div>
					<p>To put it simply, title insurance is a way to protect yourself from financial loss and related
						legal expenses in the event there is a defect in title to your property that is covered by the
						policy. Title insurance differs from other types of insurance in that it focuses on risk
						prevention, rather than risk assumption. With title insurance, title examiners review the
						history of your property and seek to eliminate title issues before the purchase occurs. Title
						insurance also differs in that it comes with no monthly payment. It’s just a one-time premium
						paid at closing.</p>
					<p>It's one of the best investments that a new homeowner can make when purchasing their property.
						Protecting yourself from unforseen events that can affect your ownership is a no-brainer.

							<h2 class="ui-title-block ui-title-block_light">Do I need Title Insurance?</h2>
							<div class="ui-decor-1 bg-primary"></div>
							<p>Absolutely. Title insurance is a way to protect what is likely your largest
								investment—your home. An Owner’s Policy provides peace of mind that your title company
								will stand behind you if a covered title issue or defect arises after you have bought
								your home.</p>
						</div><br>

						<h2 class="ui-title-block ui-title-block_light">What Does Title Insurance Cover?</h2>
						<div class="ui-decor-1 bg-primary"></div>
						<p>Any number of title issues may arise, even after the most meticulous search of public
							records. These hidden defects are dangerous because you might not learn about them for
							months, or even years, after purchase. Some common examples of risks covered by your Owner’s
							Policy include defects in title caused by:</p>
						<br>
						<p>
							<ul class="list list-mark-2">
								<li>Mistakes in recording or indexing legal documents</li>
								<li>Forgeries and fraud</li>
								<li>Undisclosed or missing heirs</li>
								<li>Unpaid taxes and assessments</li>
								<li>Unpaid judgments and liens</li>
								<li>Unreleased mortgages</li>
								<li>Mental incompetence of grantors on the deed</li>
								<li>Impersonation of the true owners of the land by fraudulent persons</li>
								<li>Refusal of a potential purchaser to accept title based on the condition of the title
								</li>

							</ul>
						</p>

						<div class="typography-section__inner">
							<h2 class="ui-title-block ui-title-block_light">How Much Does Title Insurance Cost?</h2>
							<div class="ui-decor-1 bg-primary"></div>
							<p>The one-time premium that you’ll pay for a title insurance policy varies by state, but
								generally is related to the value of your property. </p>
