					<p>Making a very large purchase, such as a house, causes buyers, sellers and lenders to seek
						reassurance about all the security measures that are in place to protect the funds involved in
						the closing transaction. Transferring large sums of money and finalizing the details of your
						sale needs to be done safely and in compliance with the latest security and privacy standards.
						To help minimize risks during real estate transactions, the escrow/settlement process was
						developed to protect the buyer, seller and lender.</p><br>
					<p>An escrow account is basically a temporary pass through account held by the escrow holder. The
						escrow holder is a neutral third party that holds funds and related documents in a secure manner
						while the parties work through the details of the real estate transaction. Escrow ensures the
						conditions of the real estate transaction have been met before the property and/or money change
						hands.</p>

						<div class="col-xs-12">
							<p>The escrow process starts when a party to a real estate transaction (seller, seller’s
								agent, buyer or buyer’s agent) opens the escrow after a written sale agreement is
								reached. Upon opening, the escrow holder should be provided with the terms of the sale
								and the information necessary to carry out tasks. The escrow holder’s duties and the
								timing of key tasks vary between states.</p>
							<p>While your real estate transaction is in escrow, your escrow officer and agent will work
								with you to make sure the right steps are taken at the right time. Tasks that the escrow
								holder may complete include:</p><br>

							<ul class="list list-mark-2">
								<li>Coordinating communications between all parties in the transaction</li>
								<li>Preparing written escrow instructions</li>
								<li>Requesting a preliminary report or commitment</li>
								<li>Requesting a statement of identity (information) from the buyer or seller as needed
								</li>
								<li>Ordering demands or beneficiary statements</li>
								<li>Receiving bills from home warranty companies, as well as pest, roof, home and other
									inspection companies</li>
								<li>Preparing or securing the deed or other recordable documents</li>
								<li>Complying with lender’s requirements</li>
								<li>Prorating taxes, interest, insurance and rents</li>
								<li>Receiving purchase funds required for closing</li>
								<li>Coordinating recording of deeds and any other necessary documents</li>
								<li>Closing escrow when all the instructions of the buyer, seller and lender have been
									carried out</li>
								<li>Disbursing funds as authorized, including charges for title insurance, recording
									fees, real estate commissions and loan payoffs</li>
								<li>Preparing final statements for the parties, which account for the disposition of all
									funds deposited in escrow</li>

							</ul>
							<p>When all instructions in escrow have been carried out to the satisfaction of each party,
								the escrow is ready to be closed. With closing, the title to the property is transferred
								to the buyer, the sales proceeds are paid over to the seller, necessary documents are
								recorded and title insurance is issued. It is important to note that the escrow holder
								does not offer legal advice, negotiate the transaction or offer investment advice.</p>
